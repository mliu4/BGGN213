##Functions revisited
Load a source file with our rescale function from last time.
```{r}
source("http://tinyurl.com/rescale-R")
```

Test this function
```{r}
rescale(1:5)
```

```{r}
rescale(c(1:5, "string"))
```

We want to make this function more robust to these types of errors.
```{r}
print("I wish I had access to the updated version")
```

Let's try something else. Something with a new function.
```{r}
#Let's define an example x and y
x <- c(1,2,NA,3,NA)
y <- c(NA,3,NA,3,4)
```

```{r}
is.na(x)
is.na(y)

is.na(x) & is.na(y)
sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
which(is.na(x)&is.na(y))
```

Let's turn it into a function

```{r}
bothNA <- function(x,y){
  sum(is.na(x)&is.na(y))
  
  
}
bothNA(x,y)
```
